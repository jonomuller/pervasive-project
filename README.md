Pervasive Group Project C03

WSN Project Paragraph

Current smart lighting in homes often requires explicit configuration through a mobile app, and tends to leave unnecessary parts of the home lit. We are proposing to develop a smart lighting system that will follow the user throughout the home and light up the area where it anticipates the user is heading. Existing systems that use infrared sensors require a line of sight with the sensor. Our project will aim to be more useful than these systems by working around corners.

Our system will track the user through a tag worn on the userâ€™s wrist, and we hope to allow the user to set the colour of the light and which lights are activated through an interface displayed on an LCD panel on the watch. The challenge of the project is to achieve this with the system remaining completely decentralised (i.e with the lights themselves deciding whether to light up or not). We plan to test this by setting up various lights around a test area, potentially with physical walls between them, and see if the light nearest to the user lights up. We should also test whether the next light in the direction that the user is heading lights up as well. If the user is equally close to two lights, the system should decide which node to light up, potentially via which one has a greater signal strength.
